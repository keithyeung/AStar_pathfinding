In this project,
Once you run it, if it finds a path right the way, you will see a yellow line going from the end point to the start point.
Otherwise you will have to make some adjustment like this:

LeftClick Mouse = make obstacle or remove obstacle.
LeftShift + LeftClick = Place starting point.
LeftControl + LeftClick = Place ending point.
Key "T" + LeftClick = Move Trade Post.
Key "S" + LeftClick = Move Spaceship.

WARNINGS:
There are a few warnings in the project but its saying that I did not initialise some variable. However I did initialise them in the OnSetUp() function, I'm not sure if having warnings are acceptable but I did realise this and I did initialise them. I hope it's fine.
